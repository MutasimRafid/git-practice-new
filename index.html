    <h1>October</h1>
    <h4>By Robert Frost</h4>
    <pre>
        O hushed October morning mild,
        Thy leaves have ripened to the fall;
        To-morrow's wind, if it be wild,
        Should waste them all.
        The crows above the forest call;
        To-morrow they may form and go.
        Begin the hours of this day slow,
        O hushed October morning mild,
